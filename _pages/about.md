Kai Wang is currently an assistant professor at the Department of Data and Business Intelligence, [Antai College of Economics and Management](https://www.acem.sjtu.edu.cn/en/), Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Before joining SJTU, he was a Research Associate in the Data and Knowledge Research Group at [University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au/) from 2020 to 2022. He got his Ph.D. from The University of New South Wales in 2020 and his bachelor’s degree from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/) in 2016, both in Computer Science. In 2015, He worked as a research assistant at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). <!--(advised by [UNSW Scientia Prof. Xuemin Lin](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~lxue/) and [Prof. Wenjie Zhang](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~zhangw/)) -->

His research interests lie in big data analytics, especially for the graph/network and spatial data.  Link to [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=G4DiwTIAAAAJ&hl=en). Email address: cskaelwang@gmail.com

*I have close cooperation with many top-tier IT companies such as Alibaba DAMO Academy. For undergraduate students, please feel free to contact me via email if you are interested in big-data-related research, especially for those who want to participate in an enterprise internship or pursue a higher-level degree.*
