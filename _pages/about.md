Kai Wang is currently a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Data and Knowledge Research Group at [University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au/). He got his Ph.D. from The University of New South Wales in 2020 (advised by [UNSW Scientia Prof. Xuemin Lin](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~lxue/) and [Prof. Wenjie Zhang](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~zhangw/)) and his bachelor’s degree from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/) in 2016, both in Computer Science. In 2015, He worked as a research assistant at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). 

His research interests lie in big data analytics, especially for the graph/network and spatial data.  Link to [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=G4DiwTIAAAAJ&hl=en).
